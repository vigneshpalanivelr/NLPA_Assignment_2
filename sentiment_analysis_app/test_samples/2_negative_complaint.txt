This is the WORST experience I've ever had!!! 😡😡😡

Ordered from @TechStore three weeks ago and the product arrived BROKEN! The packaging was damaged and the item inside was completely unusable. Customer service has been absolutely terrible - they keep giving me the runaround and refuse to provide a refund.

Major issues:
- Product arrived damaged
- Poor quality materials
- Terrible customer support
- Overpriced for what you get ($299 for THIS?!)
- Shipping took FOREVER

Save your money and DO NOT buy from this company! I'm filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. This is a complete scam and waste of money. 0/10 stars if I could give negative ratings!

#Scam #Disappointed #WorstPurchaseEver #NeverAgain

Absolute garbage. Would NOT recommend to my worst enemy. Check out the negative reviews on www.trustpilot.com - I'm not the only one!
