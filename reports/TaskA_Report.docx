================================================================================
3. DESIGN CHOICES AND RATIONALE
================================================================================

3.1 Technology Selection
-----------------------

Choice: DistilBERT (Transformer) for Sentiment Analysis
Rationale:
- State-of-the-art accuracy: 92-95% on SST-2 benchmark vs 70-80% for rule-based
- Context-aware: Bidirectional understanding of text meaning
- Transfer learning: Pre-trained on millions of texts, fine-tuned for sentiment
- Handles sarcasm and negations better through context understanding
- 66M parameters (distilled from BERT's 110M for efficiency)
- Model: "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english"
- Framework: PyTorch with Hugging Face Transformers
- GPU acceleration support for 10x faster inference

Comparison with Traditional Methods:

| Feature | DistilBERT | VADER | TextBlob |
|---------|-----------|-------|----------|
| Approach | Deep Learning (Transformer) | Rule-based Lexicon | Rule-based Lexicon |
| Context Understanding | Full bidirectional | Word-level only | Word-level only |
| Sarcasm Detection | Better (learns from context) | Poor | Poor |
| Accuracy | 92-95% | ~70-80% | ~70-80% |
| Training | 66M parameters | Fixed dictionary | Fixed dictionary |
| Speed (GPU) | ~50-100ms | <10ms | <10ms |
| Speed (CPU) | ~200-500ms | <10ms | <10ms |

Example demonstrating BERT superiority:
- Text: "This movie was not good, it was amazing!"
- VADER/TextBlob: Focuses on "not good" → Negative (INCORRECT)
- BERT: Understands full context → Positive (CORRECT)

Choice: FastAPI for Backend
Rationale:
- Modern, fast web framework with async support
- Automatic interactive API documentation (Swagger UI, ReDoc)
- Type hints and Pydantic validation for robust code
- Built-in support for multipart/form-data (file uploads)
- Easy deployment to BITS OSHA Cloud Lab
- Excellent performance for production workloads

Choice: PyTorch over TensorFlow
Rationale:
- More intuitive and Pythonic API
- Better debugging experience
- Widely used in research and industry
- Excellent Hugging Face Transformers integration
- Strong CUDA GPU support

Choice: Vanilla JavaScript (No Framework)
Rationale:
- Reduced complexity and dependencies
- Better performance for simple UI interactions
- Easier to understand and maintain for educational purposes
- Smaller bundle size (no framework overhead)
- Direct DOM manipulation sufficient for this application

Choice: Chart.js for Visualization
Rationale:
- Lightweight and easy to integrate
- Beautiful, responsive charts out of the box
- No complex dependencies like D3.js
- Perfect for bar charts showing probability distributions


3.2 Architecture Decisions
--------------------------

Decision: Dual Analysis (Original + Cleaned Text)
Rationale:
- BERT analyzes original text (preserves context, emoticons, capitalization)
- Also analyzes cleaned text (lemmatized, stopwords removed)
- Allows comparison to understand preprocessing impact
- Demonstrates that BERT handles raw text well
- Educational value showing different analysis approaches

Decision: 6-Step Preprocessing Pipeline Visualization
Rationale:
- Educational transparency for NLP learning
- Shows transformation at each step
- Word count comparison (original vs final)
- Demonstrates NLP techniques: cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization
- Helps users understand how text is processed

Decision: Probability Distributions Instead of Single Label
Rationale:
- BERT provides confidence scores for each sentiment class
- Shows positive, negative, and neutral probabilities
- More informative than binary classification
- Helps users understand model confidence
- Neutral detected when positive and negative are both moderate

Decision: RESTful API Design
Rationale:
- Standard, well-understood interface
- Easy to test independently (curl, Postman, Swagger UI)
- Can be extended for mobile apps or other clients
- Supports multiple endpoints:
  * /api/health - Health check
  * /api/analyze - Text analysis
  * /api/analyze/file - File upload analysis
  * /api/analyze/batch - Batch processing
- Automatic documentation generation

Decision: GPU Support with CPU Fallback
Rationale:
- GPU provides 10x speedup (~50-100ms vs ~200-500ms)
- Automatic detection: uses GPU if available, falls back to CPU
- Suitable for both development (CPU) and production (GPU)
- Model cached in ~/.cache/huggingface/ for fast loading


================================================================================
4. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
================================================================================

4.1 Text Preprocessing Pipeline
-------------------------------

The preprocessing pipeline implements 6 distinct steps with detailed tracking:

Step 1: Original Text
- Raw input text as provided by user
- Preserves all characters, emoticons, URLs, mentions
- Word count: Split by whitespace

Step 2: Text Cleaning
- Lowercase conversion for normalization
- URL removal: http/https/www links removed
- Mention removal: @mentions and #hashtags removed
- Special character removal: Keep only alphabets and spaces
- Number removal: Digits filtered out
- Whitespace normalization: Extra spaces removed

Step 3: Tokenization
- NLTK word_tokenize for word-level tokens
- Preserves sentence structure
- Handles punctuation and contractions
- Outputs: List of individual word tokens

Step 4: Stopword Removal
- Remove common English stopwords (NLTK corpus)
- Words like "the", "is", "at", "which", "on"
- Reduces noise while preserving sentiment-bearing words
- Optional: Can be disabled in preprocessing

Step 5: Lemmatization (Default)
- WordNet Lemmatizer reduces words to dictionary base form
- Preserves word meaning better than stemming
- Examples:
  * "running" → "run"
  * "better" → "good"
  * "words" → "word"
  * "meeting" → "meeting" (noun) or "meet" (verb)

Step 5 (Alternative): Stemming
- Porter Stemmer algorithm for aggressive word reduction
- Faster but less accurate than lemmatization
- Examples:
  * "running" → "run"
  * "runner" → "runner" or "run"
  * "runs" → "run"

Step 6: Final Cleaned Tokens
- Complete processed token list
- Summary statistics:
  * Original word count
  * Final token count
  * Words removed count
  * Reduction percentage


4.2 DistilBERT Sentiment Analysis Implementation
-----------------------------------------------

Model Architecture:
- Base Model: DistilBERT (distilled from BERT)
- Parameters: 66 million (vs 110M for full BERT)
- Layers: 6 transformer encoder layers
- Hidden Size: 768
- Attention Heads: 12
- Vocabulary Size: 30,522 WordPiece tokens
- Max Sequence Length: 512 tokens
- Fine-tuned On: Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2)

Inference Process:

1. Tokenization:
   - Text → BERT WordPiece tokens
   - Special tokens added: [CLS] text [SEP]
   - Token IDs generated for model input
   - Truncation at 512 tokens if necessary
   - Padding applied for batching

2. Encoding:
   - Token embeddings generated (768-dimensional)
   - Positional encodings added
   - Fed through 6 transformer layers
   - Self-attention mechanisms capture context
   - Bidirectional: Each token attends to all other tokens

3. Classification:
   - [CLS] token hidden state extracted
   - Fed to classification head (linear layer)
   - Output: Logits for [negative, positive]

4. Softmax Activation:
   - Logits → Probability distribution
   - negative_prob: Probability of negative sentiment
   - positive_prob: Probability of positive sentiment
   - neutral_prob: 1.0 - max(positive, negative)

5. Sentiment Determination:
   - If positive_prob > 0.6: Sentiment = Positive
   - Else if negative_prob > 0.6: Sentiment = Negative
   - Else: Sentiment = Neutral (both moderate)
   - Confidence = Highest probability value
